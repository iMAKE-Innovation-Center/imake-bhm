# Paul Revere Williams

## In English: 
Having a career that spans almost six decades, Paul Revere Williams was a pioneer in designing over 3,000 projects while breaking many racial barriers. His stamp on society can be seen throughout Southern California.

Paul Revere Williams was born on February 18, 1894 in Los Angeles, Ca.  His life did not start off with sunshine and rays as he was orphaned at age 4.  While attending grade school Williams would become the only African-American to attend the schools during his time there.  Did not stop Williams as he was able to overcome this barrier and more which would lead to Williams studying at the University of Southern California (USC). Earning a degree in architectural engineering, Williams soon became the first certified African-American architect west of the Mississippi.

Williams career was something many could admire.  He became the “architect of the stars” designing over 2,000 homes in Los Angeles alone for wealthy businessmen and people of Hollywood.  Homes were not only the result of Williams designs.  He was also key in designing affordable homes, public housing, and many civic, commercial, and institutional buildings.  One of Williams greatest attributes was the ability to draw upside down.  This allowed white clients to feel at ease as some may not have been comfortable sitting next to Williams.

Paul Revere Williams will go down in history as not only one of the greatest African American Architect, but as one of the greatest American Architect."Virtually everything pertaining to my professional life during those early years was influenced by my need to offset race prejudice, by my effort to force white people to consider me as an individual rather than a member of a race,"   – Paul Revere Williams
